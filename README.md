- 👋 Hi, I’m @IslamZindabaad
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, and more importantly, how websites and programming can change the world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make websites and how to program
- 💞️ I’m looking to work with people who know more than me about programming, and are willing to teach me and collaborate with me on their projects so that I can learn along the way.
- 📫 You can reach me by my email address:
